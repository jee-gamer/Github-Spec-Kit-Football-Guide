# Research Log: Football Role Guide Static Website

## Decision Log

- No open technical unknowns remain. All clarifications (Vite, Vitest, MIT license) have been resolved per user input.

## Rationale

- **Vite**: Chosen for its simplicity, speed, and native support for Vue.js static sites.
- **Vitest**: Chosen for its tight integration with Vite and Vue.js, and fast, modern testing experience.
- **MIT License**: Chosen for maximum openness and compatibility.

## Alternatives Considered

- **Static Site Generator**: Considered Nuxt Content and VitePress, but plain Vite was preferred for simplicity and direct control.
- **Testing**: Considered Cypress for end-to-end, but Vitest is sufficient for unit/component testing at this stage.
- **License**: Apache 2.0 and GPL were considered, but MIT is most permissive.
