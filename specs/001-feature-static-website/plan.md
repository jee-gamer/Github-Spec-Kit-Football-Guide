# Implementation Plan: Football Role Guide Static Website

**Branch**: `001-feature-static-website` | **Date**: 2025-10-15 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-feature-static-website/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a static, responsive website using Vue.js to teach users how to play each football role. The home page displays a grid of boxes, each for a specific football position (e.g., Goalkeeper, Left Back, Center Back, etc.), with a role name, player image, and structured description. The site is mobile-ready and deployable to any static host.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: JavaScript (ES2021+), Vue.js 3.x  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue.js 3.x, Vue Router (if needed), CSS (or SCSS), Vite (plain)  
**Storage**: N/A (static assets only)  
**Testing**: Vitest  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (desktop and mobile)  
**Project Type**: Static web application  
**Performance Goals**: Loads in under 2 seconds on 3G mobile; 60 FPS UI interactions  
**Constraints**: No server-side code; all assets must be static; must work offline if possible  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports all standard football roles; scalable to add more roles later

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- Static hosting: PASS (site is static, no backend)
- Entry point: PASS (index.html or Vue static entry)
- Asset management: PASS (all assets bundled statically)
- Open source license: PASS (MIT)
- Deployable to static host: PASS
- All dependencies static/CDN: PASS
- README required: PASS

No violations detected. Clarifications needed for static site generator, testing framework, and license type.

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
